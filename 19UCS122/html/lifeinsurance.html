                    <h3>Acts as a Loan Collateral</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many people are still unaware of the fact that life policies can also be used as loan collateral.
                        Based on the type of life insurance policy and its surrender value, the policyholder can opt for a loan 
                        from a bank or NBFC(Non Banking Financial Company) as per applicable terms and conditions. <br>
                        <strong>Loan Amount: </strong>Generally , the loan amount is a percentage of the surrender value of the 
                        life policy and it can go up to 90%. Only a few companies allow for a loan upto 50% of the total premium 
                        amount paid by policyholder.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Onlide Paybent Discount</h3>
                    <p>
                        The payment mode chosen by an individual drastically affects the premium of the policy.
                        Most individuals are unaware of the online payment benefit. The company's administrative costs considerably 
                        go down when an individual opts to pay the premiums online.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tax Benefits</h3>
                    <p>
                        For paying a life policy premium , a policyholder is eligible for a tax rebate under Section 80C of the
                        Income Tax Act 1961. Irrespective of self, spouse , or their children, the premium paid for parents and
                        in-laws is exempted.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This benefit is offered by all the life insurers. Additionally , the maurity benefit of life policies also 
                        qualifies for tax deductions under Section 10 (10) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
